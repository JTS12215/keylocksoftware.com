== Why KeyLock? The "Local-First" Advantage

If you're trying to decide on a Password Manager, ask yourself a critical question: *Do you truly trust your most sensitive information—banking, brokerage accounts, insurance records, Social Security numbers, and private notes—to a large private commercial password manager just waiting to be hacked?*

Traditional password managers store millions of user vaults in centralized "honeypots." These companies are under constant, sophisticated attacks because a single breach offers a massive financial windfall for hackers. 

**KeyLock changes the game:**

* **The Needle in the Haystack:** By storing your data locally or in a public cloud of your choice (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.), your vault is just one anonymous encrypted file among billions. 
* **Zero Knowledge:** Because we don't hold your data, we cannot see your passwords—and neither can hackers.
* **True Sovereignty:** Your data stays where you put it. To an outside observer, your database in a public cloud appears as an unrecognizable, encrypted file with contents unbeknownst to anyone.

==  System Requirements & Installation

=== Operating System Support
KeyLock is optimized for modern 64-bit environments to ensure maximum performance of the AES-256 encryption engine.

* **Windows 11** (64-bit)
* **Windows 10** (64-bit, version 1809 or later)

[NOTE]
Legacy systems such as Windows 7 or 8.1 are not officially supported. For your security, KeyLock should only be run on operating systems currently receiving active security patches from Microsoft.

=== Hardware Requirements
The application is lightweight and designed to run efficiently in the background without impacting system performance.

* **Memory (RAM):** 100 MB of available RAM (Minimum); 256 MB (Recommended).
* **Disk Space:** ** **Application:** ~50 MB for the initial installation.
** **Database:** Variable. Individual database files are extremely small; even a vault with thousands of entries typically requires less than 5 MB of space.

=== Permissions & Access
To maintain the "Local-First" integrity of your data, the following permissions are required:

* **File System Access:** KeyLock requires read/write permissions for its installation directory and whichever directory you choose for your database files.
* **Installer Privileges:** The Standard Installer requires **Administrative Privileges** to create the necessary directories in `C:\Program Files` and to register the application with Windows. 
* **Standalone Permissions:** The Standalone version can be run with **Standard User** permissions, provided it is placed in a directory where the user already has write access (e.g., a folder on the Desktop or a personal Documents folder).
=== Initial Download Options



=== Installation Options

* **Standard Installer:** Recommended for most users. The installer handles all directory creation, system shortcuts, and registry entries for a smooth Windows experience.
* **Standalone Executable:** Designed for the experienced user who demands total control over where the program resides. This version does not use a formal installation process; you simply place the executable in your preferred directory.

When running the installer, you will be prompted for:

* **Installation Path:** The default is `C:\Program Files\KeyLock`, but you can specify any local directory.
* **Startup Option:** Check this box to have KeyLock launch automatically when you sign into Windows.
* **Desktop Icon:** Creates a KeyLock shortcut for quick access.



[CAUTION]
====
**Windows Security Warning:** During installation, you may see a "Windows Protected Your PC" or a Blue Screen SmartScreen warning. This is a standard security measure for independent software. Click **"More Info"** and then **"Run Anyway"** to proceed.
====

=== Directory Architecture

* **Program Files:** Stores the executable and necessary system assets.
* **App Data:** Stores user configuration settings and local logs.
* **Default Database Folder:** Typically created in your `Documents\KeyLock Databases` folder. This folder is the default location where your databases, backups and exports are stored. 

== Database Setup

=== Creating Your First Database

Upon first launch, you will be prompted to create a new vault.

1. **Select Location:** You can accept the default local folder or choose a custom path.
2. **Storage Choice:** You can choose to store your database **locally** on your machine for maximum privacy, or in a **Public Cloud** directory (like your local Google Drive or Dropbox folder) for your own remote access.

3. **Master Password:** Choose a strong, memorable password.

[WARNING]
====
Losing your **Master Password** is permanent.

* There is no "Forgot Password" link.
* Our support team cannot reset it.
* Your Master Password is the only way back in.
* Write it down and store it somewhere safe.

== Migration: Importing Data

If you are moving from a cloud-based manager, KeyLock makes the transition seamless.

=== The Migration Process

1. **Export:** Log into your current password manager and export your vault as a `.csv` file.
2. **Import:** In KeyLock, go to `File > Import > CSV`.
3. **Auto-Mapping:** KeyLock features an **Auto-Mapping** engine that recognizes headers from major password managers. It will attempt to automatically match your existing "Username," "Password," and "URL" fields to the KeyLock database structure.
4. **Secure Cleanup:** Once the import is successful, **permanently delete** the plain-text CSV file from your computer.



== Uninstallation

If you need to remove KeyLock, use the Windows **Add or Remove Programs** utility.

NOTE: Uninstalling the program does **not** delete your encrypted database files. This ensures your data remains safe and available should you choose to reinstall in the future.
