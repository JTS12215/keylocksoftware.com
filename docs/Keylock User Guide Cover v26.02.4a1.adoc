== Introduction and Overview

The KeyLock Password Manager is a professional-grade security tool
designed to give you absolute control over your digital identity. Unlike
other cloud-based managers that store your data on their servers,
KeyLock is a local-first application where both the program and the
encrypted database remain entirely under your jurisdiction.

== The Importance of a Password Manager

In the modern digital landscape, using unique, complex passwords for
every account is the only defense against "credential stuffing" attacks.
A password manager eliminates the need to memorize dozens of complex
passwords, allowing you to use high-entropy passwords that are
impossible to guess.

== Multiple Databases

KeyLock supports the creation of an unlimited number of SQLite
databases. Although you can use a single database and incorporate
Business, Personal, Notes and any other Category you create and use the
Search box to filter in on a single Category. For users who wish to
separate "Business" credentials from "Personal" credentials you may
create separate databases. Each database can have its own unique Master
Password.

== The KeyLock Benefit: Sovereign Control

=== Decentralized Storage: 
* You choose exactly where your database
lives—whether on a local hard drive, a secure USB stick, or a
synchronized cloud folder.

=== Multi-Platform: 
* By storing your database in public cloud services like *Dropbox,
Google Drive, or OneDrive*, you can install KeyLock on multiple Windows,
machines and access your database vault from anywhere.

=== Zero-Knowledge Security:
* The application never transmits your master
password or unencrypted data over the internet. Encryption and
decryption happen solely on your local machine.

*  Because KeyLock uses *PBKDF2 key derivation* and *AES-authenticated
Fernet encryption*, your Master Password is the _only_ key to the vault.
If lost, the data is mathematically impossible to recover. We recommend
using the "Password Hint" feature or keeping a physical copy of your
master password in a safe or fireproof box.

* KeyLock adheres to a strict *Zero-Knowledge* policy. Because the
application does not have a "backdoor" and does not store your master
password in any form, there is *no recovery process*. This is a
deliberate security feature: if a recovery method existed for you, it
would also exist for a hacker. You are the sole custodian of your data.

[WARNING]
====
Losing your **Master Password** is permanent.

* There is no "Forgot Password" link.
* Our support team cannot reset it.
* Your Master Password is the only way back in.
* Write it down and store it somewhere safe.
====

== Security Architecture and Encryption

* KeyLock is built on a "Hardened Security" model to ensure that even if
your database file is stolen, the contents remain inaccessible.

=== Encryption Standards
** Fernet (AES-128/256):
* KeyLock utilizes the cryptography.fernet
library for symmetric encryption, which provides "authenticated
encryption" that prevents tampering.

** Key Derivation:
* Your master password is never stored. Instead,
KeyLock uses a PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) with a
unique 16-byte random *Salt* to derive the encryption key.

** The Database Structure: 
* The database is a SQLite file (.db) containing a vault table with the following 
columns: Catagory, Title, URL, Username,
Password, Account, PIN & Notes.
* salt: The unique random value used to derive your key.
* data: The encrypted JSON blob containing your passwords and recycle
bin.
* hint: An optional, unencrypted text string to help you remember your
password.

== Interface Navigation

The interface is designed for high-efficiency security management,
divided into four primary control zones: the Menu Bar, the Ribbon
Toolbar, Status Bar and the Table view.
